# Developer Guide

:: stub

This will have content explaining everything about how the code works, so that another programmer can understand how it's doing what it's doing and it should make it easier for others to modify & extend what I've built.

For example, it will include a bunch of PlantUML Diagrams which clarify each of the classes & the execution of the program.
