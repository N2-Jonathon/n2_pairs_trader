You can either read the docs here on github inside the docs/ directory
- Or you can build it with mkdocs using the command: `mkdocs build && mkdocs serve` then you'll be able to access it from localhost:8000
- Or you can see what it looks like hosted on a server [here](http://5.180.183.48/). In those docs, I plan to make both a user guide and developer guide
Note: I didn't realize that each time I build the docs and then push to github, it counts as 'new' html so on the project stats, it now says it's 75% html
