Okay so it's difficult to know where to begin but I'll make an outline of things I think are important to communicate: 

- I'll start with an honest self-assessment as a developer:

<i class="fa fa-camera-retro fa-2x"></i> fa-2x
<i class="fa fa-camera-retro fa-3x"></i> fa-3x
<i class="fa fa-camera-retro fa-4x"></i> fa-4x
<i class="fa fa-camera-retro fa-5x"></i> fa-5x

i <3 :fa-coffee: and I <3 :fa-beer: and I'll buy wayland ten of both. 



## Strengths:
* Good problem solver. I approach problems methodically in a way that I imagine a senior developer would, and each time I get stuck, I get unstuck:
* Good at stepping through & debugging python code. Even if I don't understand something at first, I will step through each line of code as it executes to understand what is happening, and eventually figure out the source of whatever challenge I'm currently facing.
* Track the time I spend coding with WakaTime, and I also track the time I spend learning instead of building and I don't require that you pay for the learning. Since I am still learning, I think the per-project payment model is more fair instead of per-hour, because I can deliver the same results as a senior developer but it may take me more time than a senior developer.
* I document my code, and provide commentary on my thought & decision processes. You can see an example of that here (unfinished & outdated as it's my current project): http://5.180.183.48/
* I know PlantUML for creating activity diagrams & other useful graphics like class/object diagrams
* I first started learning to code more than 12 years ago
* Committed. I don't give up even when I get stuck or frustrated
* I find your project genuinely interesting
* Good at judging whether or not I'm capable of doing something, and able to describe problems in an easy to understand way, and think of new solutions

## Weaknesses.
* Even though I started learning to code 12 years ago, it was very on and off and I never truly started to take it seriously until this year, 2022, and I feel like I've finally reached a new level where I know that if I just spend enough time and focus on a problem that I'm capable of solving it.
* Even though I know some advanced programming concepts & paradigms implemented in python since that's the language I've spent the most time with, it would take me time to learn their equivilent implementations in JS (But I can do it)
* I'm not very good at estimating how long something takes to build, even when I know I can do it.
